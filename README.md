# CadenDennis1810Final
Caden Dennis 1810 Final Project:

My Final Project will be a combination Final with my 1410 class where in I shall create a multiplayer game(s). 
My Primary game will be an extremely interactive version of Battleship with variable attack patterns, Audio, and an admin overview where specators are able to see a version of the game
where all game information is properly portrayed to the specator. I had chosen this topic after some deliberation where in I was debating with a number of options such as Monopoly, Stratigo, Chess and a few others.
I have decided to bring this project over to 1810 for the sake of allowing myself to place exceptional focus on the Visual, Audio, and Responsive elements. While pulling a number of things from C#
to make the game program function my goal is to build the website and design in Javascript, CSS, and HTML so that I have a non-blazor looking website. Blazor being the chosen Appearance for 
the CS 1410 version of the Project.

Otherwise my choice in this topic lies in a few elements, 
* HTML/CSS/Javascript heavy version for the website of my Multiplayer Game
* Running Audio that doesn't require user interaction
* creating an interconnected web of Sites that allow for me to access any games that are available inside my C# api.
